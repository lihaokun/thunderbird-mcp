> Inspired by [bb1/thunderbird-mcp](https://github.com/bb1/thunderbird-mcp). Rewritten from scratch with a bundled HTTP server, proper MIME decoding, and UTF-8 handling throughout.

An MCP server that lets AI assistants read email, manage calendars, and compose messages in Thunderbird.

## How it works

```
MCP Client <--stdio--> mcp-bridge.cjs <--HTTP--> Thunderbird Extension
```

The Thunderbird extension runs a local HTTP server on port 8765. The Node.js bridge translates between MCP's stdio protocol and HTTP so MCP clients can talk to it.

## Setup

**1. Install the extension**

```bash
./scripts/build.sh
./scripts/install.sh
```

Restart Thunderbird.

**2. Configure your MCP client**

Example for `~/.claude.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "thunderbird-mail": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/thunderbird-mcp/mcp-bridge.cjs"]
    }
  }
}
```

## What you can do

| Tool | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `listAccounts` | List all email accounts and their identities |
| `listFolders` | List all mail folders with message counts |
| `searchMessages` | Find emails by subject, sender, recipient, or date range |
| `getMessage` | Read full email content with optional attachment saving |
| `updateMessage` | Mark read/unread, flag/unflag, move to folder, or trash |
| `sendMail` | Open a compose window with pre-filled content |
| `replyToMessage` | Reply with quoted original and proper threading |
| `forwardMessage` | Forward with original attachments preserved |
| `searchContacts` | Look up contacts |
| `listCalendars` | List your calendars |
| `createEvent` | Open a pre-filled calendar event dialog |

Compose tools open a window for you to review before sending. Nothing gets sent automatically.

## Security

The extension only listens on localhost, but any local process can access it while Thunderbird is running. Keep this in mind on shared machines.

## Troubleshooting

**Extension not loading?**
Check Tools → Add-ons and Themes. For errors: Tools → Developer Tools → Error Console.

**Connection refused?**
Make sure Thunderbird is running and the extension is enabled.

**Can't find recent emails?**
IMAP folders can be stale. Click on the folder in Thunderbird to sync, or right-click → Properties → Repair Folder.

## Development

```bash
# Build the extension
./scripts/build.sh

# Test the HTTP API directly
curl -X POST http://localhost:8765 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}'

# Test the bridge
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}' | node mcp-bridge.cjs
```

After changing extension code, you'll need to remove it from Thunderbird, restart, reinstall, and restart again. Thunderbird caches aggressively.

## Known issues

- IMAP folder databases can be stale until you click on them
- Email bodies with control characters get sanitized to avoid breaking JSON
- HTML-only emails are converted to plain text (original formatting is lost)
